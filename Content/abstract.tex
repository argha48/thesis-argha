Light is an electromagnetic field and it has the ability to transfer linear or angular momentum to an interacting object. This property can be utilized to control and guide a particle along certain trajectory. One special scenario is trapping and pulling objects towards the source of the beam of light over a long range, opposite to the direction of propagation. To generate such a force field, the mode of light, which is known as ``Tractor Beams'', has to be a superposition of non-diffracting Bessel beams with special characteristics. Generating such modes of light require understanding of the propagation of electromagnetic field through space and different optics necessary to transform wavefronts into certain functional form.

This thesis starts with an illustration of the formalism used to describe the propagation and diffraction of electromagnetic wave in a mode of light followed by an introduction to the holographic creation of propagation invariant modes of light and their use in many fields of science. The goal of this thesis is to achieve long range optical micromanipulation of colloidal particles and this is the theme for the second half of this report. In Chapter \ref{ch:intermediate} we introduce a new experimental technique called ``Intermediate Plane Holography'' which can extend the range of any non-diffraction mode of light that can be written as a superposition of multiple Bessel beams. We demonstrate this technique through first experimental realization of long-range tractor beams extended upto a couple of meters and with better power efficiency compared to previously reported creation of such modes of light.

Finally, we utilize intermediate plane holography to create accelerating beam of light to resolve the apparent violation of Ehrenfest's theorem in case of shape preserving wavepackets of a quantum mechanical particle.
